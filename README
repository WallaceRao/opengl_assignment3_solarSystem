Assignment 3
Student Name: Yonghui Rao

Usage:

#1 Press space to pause the animation;
#2 Hover the planet with mouse will highlight it (It is implemented by matching the pixel color with planet color)

Build:
You can compile the source files via makefile or command "g++ -o test main.cpp textFile.cpp -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw"


Files:
main.cpp: the primary cpp file, draws spheres. Reads, compiles and links shaders
textFile.h/textFile.cpp: Read shaders.
test.vert: Vertex shader source code.
test.frag: Fragment shader source code.
makefile: for make
screenShots: *.png


Implementation:
1. Each of the objects is drawn as a tessellated sphere using the tessellation shaders, with its
own radius and colour.
2. The planets circle the star, each on its own path and with its own velocity.
3. The space bar can be used to pause and resume the animation.
4. The scene is lit by a single point light source located at the centre of the star. The star itself
is lit by a bright ambient light. The Phong lighting model with Phong (per-fragment, smooth) shading
is to be used.
5. When the mouse pointer hovers over a planet, it is drawn in a bright highlight colour.
6. The scene is rendered with perspective projection


The source code could be compiled on both linux and windows.
